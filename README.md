## Getting Started
> [!TIP]
> You can set up Copycord using Docker or the manual launcher

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://github.com/Copycord/Copycord/blob/main/docs/Instructions.md) or manual installer (See below)
- Discord Account Token + Discord Bot Token

### Setup

1. **Prepare the clone server**  
   Create a new Discord server to receive mirrored content and house your bot.

2. **Obtain your user token**

   - Log into Discord in a browser with your account.
   - Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - Enable device emulation mode (Ctrl+Shift+M), then paste the code below into the console and press Enter:
     ```js
     const iframe = document.createElement('iframe')
     console.log(
       'Token: %c%s',
       'font-size:16px;',
       JSON.parse(
         document.body.appendChild(iframe).contentWindow.localStorage.token
       )
     )
     iframe.remove()
     ```
   - Copy and store this token securely.

3. **Create and configure the bot**
   - In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new bot.
   - Under **Installation**, set the Install Link to `None` and click save.
   - Under **Bot**, click reset token and store your bot token somewhere secure, disable `Public Bot`, and enable these intents:
     - `Presence`
     - `Server Members`
     - `Message Content`
   - Under **OAuth2**, generate an invite url with (Scopes: `bot`, Bot Permissions: `Administrator`) and invite the bot to your clone server.

## Docker Install

### 1. Create a copycord folder and add docker-compose.yml

```
copycord/
├── docker-compose.yml # docker compose file
